# CPE-student-register-database-system
This program is the registration of the CPE student in KMUTT.
It holds six datum of each student including
1. Student ID
2. Student name
3. Student date of birth
4. Student home province
5. Latest GPA
6. Student gender

In some fields, I use the first project which is validating program to validate whether 
user includes the correct format of those data or not such as student ID, Date of birth.

It has three menus to do in the interface which are
1. Display current students in the database
2. Add the new record
3. Search and Modify the current student in the database
